# BigOlJungle 🌿🐒

BigOlJungle is an assorted collection of open-source web projects that I chip away at when I have free time. The overall vision is to make reading, writing, and following content on the web more fun.

Projects:
- JungleReader: [WIP] Online web-reader. Read whatever you like, across the web.
- JungleWriter: [WIP] Online website-builder. Create your own free-form websites.
- SkyLizard: [WIP] A simple tool to help you host server-side apps.

All projects are free and under an AGPL license.

See the sub-directories for project-specific READMEs.
