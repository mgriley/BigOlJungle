# 🌴 BigOlJungle

BigOlJungle is an assorted collection of open-source web projects that I chip away at when I have free time. The overall vision is to make reading, writing, and following content on the web more fun.

Mainly for hobbyists and artists/designers who are looking to create something more free-form, instead of a traditional site.
