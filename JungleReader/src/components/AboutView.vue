    JungleReader is a free+open-source all-terrain web reader.
    </p>
    <p>
    It's made to help you keep up with the sites you like,
    whatever they may be.

    Out of the box, it supports RSS, Mastodon, YouTube, and more. It has a flexible plugin system designed to let devs
    add support for almost any other site or data source.

    Your data and reader config are stored locally in your browser. The data should stay
    around even if you clear your browser's cookies / data, but make sure to export your config sometimes. Cloud backup & sync is coming soon.

    I (Matt Riley) made this site as a hobby project, hope you like it :) I have more 
    web related projects brewing (JungleWriter, JungleServer, JungleMask, ...), so stay tuned. 
    I made a newsletter where I'll send occassional updates for anyone who wants to follow along.
