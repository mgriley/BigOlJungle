    JungleReader is a free + open source web reader, made to help you keep up with the sites you like.

    It supports RSS, YouTube, Reddit, Mastodon, Twitter, and more. It also has a flexible plugin system that allows developers
    to add support for sites that aren't supported out of the box.

    Your data and reader config are stored locally in your browser. The data should stay
    around even if you clear your browser's cookie / data. Right now there is no device sync,
    so if you want to read on your phone and desktop, it is recommended that you set things up
    on desktop then export the config for your phone.
