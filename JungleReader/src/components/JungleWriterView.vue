    <p>
    The next piece of this extended hobby project is to create a web app called JungleWriter.
    JungleWriter will be a simple website-builder. It will help people build a static site then
    deploy it to one of the many free or cheap hosting services.
    </p>
    <p>
    The goal is to lower the barrier to entry for creating one's own website.
    The base site will support: short-form posts (text+image), long-form markdown posts, a file/asset directory,
    and perhaps an image gallery. It will support RSS automatically and include a nice "Follow on JungleReader" button. It will also have some option for username/password
    access, for private sites.
    </p>
    <p>
    I think you need both a decent web-reader and web-writer to make creating websites fun. If you'd like to follow along, you can subscribe to the newsletter in the About page.
